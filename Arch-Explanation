Microservices Architecture:
    Microservices can help in modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

User Service:
    Handles user registration, authentication, and account management.
    Manages user reservations and transaction history.

Parking Service:
    Manages parking spots, spot allocation, and real-time updates.
    Communicates with sensors for spot availability updates.

    Manages communication channels (e.g., email, SMS).
    
Analytics Service:
    Collects and analyzes parking data.

Benefits of Microservices:
    Scalability: Each service can be scaled independently.
    Maintainability: Easier to update and maintain smaller services.
    Fault Isolation: Failures in one service don't affect others.

Communication between Microservices:
    Used RESTful APIs for inter-service communication.
